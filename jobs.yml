# ---------------------------Eclusion feature added by Brunus ---------------------------------
# Hi added an exclusion feature, something realy needed to monitor a website tree for exemple
# brunus.v@gmail.com or @brunus_V on tweeter
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This is a sample jobs file. Yours should go in ~/.watcher/jobs.yml
# if you run watcher.py start, this file and folder will be created

job1:
  # a generic label for a job.  Currently not used make it whatever you want
  label: Watch /var/www for added or removed files

  # directory or file to watch.  Probably should be abs path.
  watch: /var/www
  # directories or files to exclude
  exclude: ['/var/www/site1/cache', '/var/www/site2/cache']

  # list of events to watch for.
  # supported events:
  # 'access' - File was accessed (read) (*)
  # 'atrribute_change' - Metadata changed (permissions, timestamps, extended attributes, etc.) (*)
  # 'write_close' - File opened for writing was closed (*)
  # 'nowrite_close' - File not opened for writing was closed (*)
  # 'create' - File/directory created in watched directory (*)
  # 'delete' - File/directory deleted from watched directory (*)
  # 'self_delete' - Watched file/directory was itself deleted
  # 'modify' - File was modified (*)
  # 'self_move' - Watched file/directory was itself moved
  # 'move_from' - File moved out of watched directory (*)
  # 'move_to' - File moved into watched directory (*)
  # 'open' - File was opened (*)
  # 'all' - Any of the above events are fired
  # 'move' - A combination of 'move_from' and 'move_to'
  # 'close' - A combination of 'write_close' and 'nowrite_close'
  #
  # When monitoring a directory, the events marked with an asterisk (*) above
  # can occur for files in the directory, in which case the name field in the
  # returned event data identifies the name of the file within the directory.
  events: ['create', 'move_from', 'move_to', 'delete', 'modify']

  # TODO:
  # this currently isn't implemented, but this is where support will be added for:
  # IN_DONT_FOLLOW, IN_ONESHOT, IN_ONLYDIR and IN_NO_LOOP
  # There will be further documentation on these once they are implmented
  options: []

  # if true, watcher will monitor directories recursively for changes
  recursive: true

  # the command to run. Can be any command. It's run as whatever user started watcher.
  # The following wildards may be used inside command specification:
  # $$ dollar sign
  # $watched watched filesystem path (see above)
  # $filename event-related file name
  # $tflags event flags (textually)
  # $nflags event flags (numerically)
  # $dest_file this will manage recursion better if included as the dest (especially when copying or similar)
  #     if $dest_file was left out of the command below, Watcher won't properly
  #     handle newly created directories when watching recursively. It's fine
  #     to leave out when recursive is false or you won't be creating new
  #     directories.
  # $src_path is only used in move_to and is the corresponding path from move_from
  # $src_rel_path [needs doc]
  # $datetime output date and time of the event, format is : Y-m-d H:M:S
  # command: cp -r $filename /home/user/Documents/$dest_file # $src_path
  command: echo $datetime $filename $tflags # $src_path
