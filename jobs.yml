job1:
  # a generic label for a job.  Currently not used make it whatever you want
  label: Watch /tmp for added or removed files

  # directory or file to watch.  Probably should be abs path.
  watch: /tmp

  # list of events to watch for.
  # supported events:
  # 'access' - File was accessed (read) (*)
  # 'atrribute_change' - Metadata changed (permissions, timestamps, extended attributes, etc.) (*)
  # 'write_close' - File opened for writing was closed (*)
  # 'nowrite_close' - File not opened for writing was closed (*)
  # 'create' - File/directory created in watched directory (*)
  # 'delete' - File/directory deleted from watched directory (*)

  # 'self_move' - Watched file/directory was itself moved
  # 'move_from' - File moved out of watched directory (*)
  # 'move_to' - File moved into watched directory (*)

  # 'all' - Any of the above events are fired
  # 'move' - A combination of 'move_from' and 'move_to'
  # 'close' - A combination of 'write_close' and 'nowrite_close'
  #
  # When monitoring a directory, the events marked with an asterisk (*) above
  # can occur for files in the directory, in which case the name field in the
  # returned event data identifies the name of the file within the directory.
  events: ['create', 'delete']

  # TODO:
  # this currently isn't implemented, but this is where support will be added for:
  # IN_DONT_FOLLOW, IN_ONESHOT, IN_ONLYDIR and IN_NO_LOOP
  # There will be further documentation on these once they are implmented
  options: []

  # if true, watcher will monitor directories recursively for changes
  recursive: true
  
  # the command to run. Can be any command. It's run as whatever user started watcher.
  # The following wildards may be used inside command specification:
  # $$ dollar sign
  # $watched watched filesystem path (see above)
  # $filename event-related file name
  # $tflags event flags (textually)
  # $nflags event flags (numerically)
  command: ls -l $filename
